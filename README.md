This project uses p5.js to implement L-Systems. L-Systems is a method that used to
procedurally generate plants through recursive grammars.

Defining a Grammar 
==================

Input grammar file format for the program:

```
<Angle in degrees>  
<Length>  
<Reduction Factor>  
<Initial Sentence/Axiom>  
<Expansion Rules>  
```

To illistrate the above format, here is "Dragon Curve.txt":

```
90 <- Angle  
200 <- Length  
.73 <- Reduction Factor  
FX <- Initial Sentence/Axiom  
X=X+YF+ <- Expansion Rule  
Y=-FX-Y <- Expansion Rule  
```

From the file, the program is able to extract all information specified in order to
properly store, expand, and draw the l-system.

Here are all the possible axioms/control characters for defining expansion rules and 
the initial axiom/sentence:

* +: Rotate by the specified angle

* -: Rotate by the negative of the specified angle

* [: Push current state of the l-system onto the matrix stack

* ]: Pop prior state of the l-system off of the matrix stack

* f: Move foward without drawing a line

* X and Y: Do nothing. Usually used for rational/angular control of the l-system

* Capital letters (expect X and Y): Move forward and draw a line.

Using the above information, the program utilizes turtle graphics rendering when 
creating the l-system. Examples of grammar input files can be found in the 
"Assets" folder.

Controls
========

## Keyboard Controls

 * Up arrow key: Changes to the next l-system
 
 * Down arrow key: Changes to the previous l-system

 * Left arrow key: Increases the angle that is used to create the l-system

 * Rightarrow key: Decreases the angle that is used to create the l-system

 * R: Reset l-system to the original sentence and reset canvas viewing parameters

 * Z: Resets the viewing parameters

 * C: Changes the color mode between RGB nad HSB on the selected l-system
    
## Mouse Controls

 * Mouse wheel: Increases or decreases the zoom of the canvas

 * Left click: Click and drag on the canvas to pan

## GUI Controls

 * Expand button: On click, it will expand the sentence of the l-system and draw it.
